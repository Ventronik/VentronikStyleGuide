## Mission Statement

VENTRONIK is about coding, coding well, and coding frequently. Creating new and interesting projects to advance my own education with an ultimate aim to begin creating projects to better society as I attain mastery. The coding of VENTRONIK is meant to be shared, to be used, and to be appreciated. As personal projects and coding become more advanced the ultimate aim is to pursue and develop projects in accordance with my values and ideals. 

## Purpose of this guide

The VENTRONIK brand is my formal, online, professional representation of myself in the cyberspace. All projects going forward will be adhering to this standard. The online presence of Dustin Ruskell, as prepresented by the username VENTRONIK is to differentiate my development projects both personal and professional from other aspects of my personal life. As development of new projects becomes more frequent having predetermined styles and palette will make future styling go more smoothly and prevent project hangups and delays caused by aesthetic and styling decisions.

This style guide is to record decisions about my style in a single source of truth for further references without having to store all of this information in my head.

The VENTRONIK splash image is meant for banners above avatars, and landing pages. It is an excellent filler image and brand mark.

## Tone
Any writing or copy should be "deep" corporate speak to of being obfuscating. The main reason is because I find it enjoyable and entertaining to write in such an obtuse manner and to disarm people finding my work to take them by surprise.
